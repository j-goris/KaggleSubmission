# KaggleSubmission
In this repository are stored all the work done in order to prepare the kaggle submission but more specifically the data science formation. Please read the README to understand the structure of the work.

In order to prepare the formation 3 things have been done (not including the few first exercises) :
  - The advised tutorial have been followed. Unfortunately, using Azure ML bring few issues (like the possibility to use a two classes approach for in the logit regression). The main ideas have been reviewed and study. We understood that three methods were used : Logit regression, SVM and decision trees. The last one was not really efficient. The second depends on the parameters used (especially the shape of the surfaces used to divide the space). A special issue was encountered concerning the export of a CSV file from a notebook to the local disk. (Stored here in TryTitanic.ipynb)
  - A small model using the Experiments part of the Azure platform. It was interesting to see that we can have a simple but efficient button-click model building. (Can be found here: https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/AXA-GORIS-ExperimentDataScience)
  - A personnal example using various tutorial have been build. The main idea of this part was to manipulate Python by our own, not taking too long to debug. A list of what should be improve has been included at the end of the document. (Stored here in TryTitanicPerso.ipynb)
  
This approach in three part (data science knowledge, Azure ML platform manipulation and python manipulation) has been decided due to time constraint. As the period was busy, it was difficult to take more time to really build a performant and reliable model with all the required check.

The result of the last personnal example has been submit to Kaggle in order to see the procedure and to estimate the performance which was probably not at its best.

I hope this approach is in adequacy with the main idea of the formation. Code quality can definitely be improved.
